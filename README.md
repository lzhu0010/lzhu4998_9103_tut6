Imaging Technique Inspiration：
Rain is indeed a common natural occurrence, yet in the realm of literary and artistic expression, it often serves as a powerful tool to evoke a sense of melancholy among the audience. The way rain is refracted through glass can further contribute to creating a hazy and somber atmosphere within a scene. Consequently, I believe that incorporating rain effects into design projects can be an effective means of conveying the poignant theme associated with cold colors.

Coding Technique Exploration：
This program creates a falling raindrop effect. White vertical lines will appear on the page starting from random positions and falling downwards. The falling speed of each line will gradually increase until it reaches the bottom of the page and disappears. This code creates a simple raindrop animation effect using JavaScript and CSS. Although the logic of the program is not very complicated, I think it is a good beginning and can pave the way for subsequent design.
